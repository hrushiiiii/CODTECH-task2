Overview of the Project: Student Grade Tracker in Python
A student grade tracker in Python is a project designed to store and manage students' grades, providing an easy way for teachers or administrators to track student performance over time. This project involves storing information about students, subjects, and their grades, and allows the user to perform various tasks such as adding new students, recording grades, calculating averages, and viewing overall performance.

Key Features:
Student Management:

Add new students to the system.
View the list of all students.
Grade Management:

Record grades for different subjects.
Update or remove grades if needed.
Grade Calculation:

Calculate the average grade for each student.
Show the highest and lowest grades.
Optionally, calculate GPA (Grade Point Average) if a specific grading scale is used.
User-Friendly Interface:

A simple menu-driven program that allows the user to navigate through different features (view grades, add student, etc.).
Data Storage:

Option to save data in a dictionary during runtime or to store the data in a file (e.g., using CSV or JSON for persistence between program runs).
Steps to Implement the Student Grade Tracker
Define Data Structures:

Use dictionaries to store student names and their associated grades.
Optionally use a list to store subjects or courses.
Implement Functions for Key Features:

Functions to add a new student, record grades, calculate averages, and display student performance.
Menu System:

Create a simple text-based menu that allows the user to select different actions (add a student, view grades, calculate averages, etc.).
Error Handling:

Ensure proper handling of edge cases like missing students, invalid grade input, or empty grade lists.
